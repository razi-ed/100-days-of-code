##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: October 17, 2018 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:
***FreeCodeCamp***. I've started with `Build a Tribute Page` project.

**Thoughts** I've been spending alot of time dealing with frontend framework and now pure HTML-CSS feels alien to me.

### Day 2: October 18, 2018 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**:
***FreeCodeCamp***. I've successfully completed `Build a Tribute Page` project.
***HacktoberFest***. Added antd UI framework and set up App layout.

**Thoughts** `FCC`: Even though it is not as fancy as I wanted it to be, it fulfills the userstories with simple and uncluttered styling. I am teaching myself to complete the main objectives primarily then try to incorporate some `good-to-have` elements.

### Day 3: October 19, 2018 - Friday

**Today's Progress**:
***FreeCodeCamp***. I've started with `Build a Survey Form` project.

**Thoughts** I am on my short vacation. So, I am not putting in much time with a mental note that I'll make upto it once I am working again. I want to mould myself gradually into the habit of coding an hour a day for learning which is why I've started with FCC projects.

### Day 4: October 22, 2018 - Friday

**Today's Progress**:
***Serverless***. I am understanding the fundamentals involved in serverless architecture. I have coded a simple `hello world` implementation too.

**Thoughts** I am back from my short vacation. So, from now on I ll be putting in much more time in the area I want to understand and implement. I am planning to create a portfolio with blog web app built using Serverless architecture.
