##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: October 17, 2018 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:
***FreeCodeCamp***. I've started with `Build a Tribute Page` project.

**Thoughts** I've been spending alot of time dealing with frontend framework and now pure HTML-CSS feels alien to me.

### Day 2: October 18, 2018 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**:
***FreeCodeCamp***. I've successfully completed `Build a Tribute Page` project.

**Thoughts** Even though it is not as fancy as I wanted it to be, it fulfills the userstories with simple and uncluttered styling. I am teaching myself to complete the main objectives primarily then try to incorporate some `good-to-have` elements.
